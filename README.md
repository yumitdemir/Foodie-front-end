# Project Overview
Welcome to Foodie, my project where I’m exploring the world of full-stack development. It’s a recipe search web app that uses ingredients as filters. The goal is to help users find the perfect recipe based on what they have in their pantry. Each recipe comes with detailed steps and additional information.

## What I’m Working On
I’m currently working on a couple of exciting features:

- A comment section for each recipe, which will allow users to share their experiences and tips.
- An admin dashboard that will help me manage various aspects of the website, including users, recipes, ingredients, and tags.
## Technology Stack
Here’s a bit about the technologies I’m using for this project:
### Backend
I’m using ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend. It handles all the server-side operations of the application. Currently, it has endpoints for ingredients, recipes, recipe tags, and users.
### Frontend
The front end is built with React. It consists of two main parts:
Admin Dashboard: This is where I’ll be able to manage the website’s content.
Guest Pages: These are the user-facing pages where guests can search for and view recipes.
This project is a great learning experience for me. Stay tuned for more updates!
